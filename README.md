# ESP8266-Arduino-Library
!!!!THE MOST EASIEST AND SIMPLE TO USE ARDUINO LIBRARY EVER!!!! 




i have used the recent low cost version of ESP8266 (ESP-01), and set the baudrate of it using a usb to serial converter(FTDI R232) by the AT Command
AT+CIOBAUD=9600 before connecting it to Arduino UNO Software Serial pin2(rx of arduino) and pin3(tx pin of arduino), if you want to use Mega or other big boy then you can use Hardware Serial2, though you can change it in my code easily as per your demand! you can also change the baudrate in the line containing 

"#define baudrate 9600"

here is a link for sample view of ESP8266 i used: http://www.amazon.com/Addicore-ESP8266-Tranceiver-Antistatic-Compatible/dp/B00PA3UQNI
